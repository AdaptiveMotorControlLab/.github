## Welcome to the Mathis Lab of Adaptive Motor Control ðŸ‘‹

We are a team of neuroscientists, computer scientists and enigneers that come together to tackle one of the largest challanges in neuroscience - how does the brain drive adaptive behavior.
Check out our [website for more information](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/), and see our open source code below!

Of particular interest:

- [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut): for animal pose estimation
- [CEBRA](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA): for supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction (behavioral data, neural, or both!)
- [cellseg3D](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CellSeg3d): for 3D mesoSPIM segmentation of soma
