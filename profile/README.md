## Welcome to the Mathis Lab  üëã 

We are a team of neuroscientists, computer scientists and enigneers that come together to tackle one of the largest challanges in neuroscience - how does the brain drive adaptive behavior. 
Our world is always changing: how do our brains adapt? We develop new machine learning methods that enable us to understand the mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior in intelligence systems, aka ‚Äúadaptive intelligence‚Äù.

Of particular interest:

- [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut): for animal pose estimation
- [CEBRA](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA): for supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction (behavioral data, neural, or both!)
- [cellseg3D](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CellSeg3d): for 3D mesoSPIM segmentation of cell soma
